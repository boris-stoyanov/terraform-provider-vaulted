[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/sumup-oss/terraform-provider-vaulted)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/sumup-oss/terraform-provider-vaulted)

A terraform provider that utilizes https://github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted to provide 
 https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform for https://github.com/hashicorp/vault encrypted secrets via 
  `resource.vaulted_vault_secret` that:
  
* are **never** stored as plaintext in your terraform state.
* are **never** logged in stdout as plaintext.
* can be **safely** stored in SCM such as Git in their encrypted payload format produced by https://github.com/sumup-oss/vaulted .

Tested and used against https://github.com/hashicorp/vault official docker image versions:

* `0.9.x`,
* `0.11.6`,
* `1.0.3`,
* `1.1.0`,
* latest
